# Dev Challenge

This repository contains the frontend application in the  `my-app` folder and the backend in the `myapi` folder. 

They are not fully complete due to an error I was receiving in regards to `cors`. This hindered my effort to have both parts of the system communicating.

I implemented backend functions to do `factorial`, `common multiples` and `squarerroot`. 

They are accessible via the following urls.

> localhost:8000/factorial/

Provide a post request with a variable called `operand`

> localhost:8000/common/

Provide a post request with two variables called `operand1` and `operand2`

> localhost:8000/squareroot/

Provide a post request with a variable called `operand`
